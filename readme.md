# Deprecated

I failed to find an active maintainer. See [linter-jshint](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-jshint) for an alternative. However, I would strongly recommend trying out [ESLint](http://eslint.org) ([Atom plugin](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint)) instead. It's just so much better than JSHint. [XO](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo) ([Atom plugin](https://github.com/sindresorhus/atom-linter-xo)), which is an ESLint wrapper with sensible defaults, is also a good choice.
